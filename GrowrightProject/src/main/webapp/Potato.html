            <div>
            <p> Let’s explore some of the most common types of potatoes. Each 
            variety has its unique qualities, making it better suited for 
            specific cooking methods.</p>
            </div>
            
            <li><em><strong>Starchy Potatoes:</strong></em>
          These potatoes have more starch content, resulting in a dry, 
          fluffy texture.
          Ideal for baking, frying, and making mashed potatoes.Examples include:
          Russet: Perfect for baked potatoes.
          Idaho: Great for fries due to their fluffy interior and crispy exterior.
          King Edward: A classic choice for roasting.</li>
      <li><em><strong>Waxy Potatoes:</strong></em>
          Low in starch, waxy potatoes have a moist flesh that holds together well.
          Best for boiling, salads, casseroles, and layered dishes.
          Examples include:
          Red Potatoes: Excellent for potato salads.
          Fingerling Potatoes: Small, elongated, and perfect for roasting.
          New Potatoes: Harvested early, they’re waxy and delicious.</li>
      <li><em><strong>All-Purpose Potatoes:</strong></em>
          As the name suggests, these are versatile and work well for various purposes.
          Not as starchy as Russets, nor as waxy as Reds.
          Good for mashed potatoes, soups, and casseroles.
          Examples include:
          Yukon Gold: Creamy and great for all-around cooking.
          White Potatoes: A balance between starchy and waxy.
          Desirée: Holds its shape when cooked.</li></p>

      <p><strong><em>Remember, the right potato choice can elevate your dish!</em></strong></p>

      <div class="soil_types">
      <h2 class="h2 three">Soil/Temperature</h2>
      <p> The best soil for potatoes is loose sandy loamy soil. This type of soil allows the tubers to 
          expand 
          easily and prevents 
          them from becoming deformed.
          Soil pH: Potatoes prefer a soil pH range of 5.5 to 6.51. This slightly acidic environment is 
          optimal for their growth and 
          helps 
          prevent certain soil-borne diseases.
          Drainage: Good drainage is crucial. Potatoes dislike soggy soil, as it can lead to rot and other 
          diseases.
          Organic Matter: Adding well-rotted compost or other organic matter can improve soil structure, 
          provide nutrients, and enhance 
          the soil’s ability to retain moisture without becoming waterlogged.
          Depth: Potatoes need about 8 inches of loose soil below the surface for the roots and tubers to              grow properly. During the 
          growing season, you may need to add up to 12 inches of soil above the surface as part of the                 chilling process . Storing 
          potatoes properly is essential to maintain their freshness and prevent spoilage. Here are the best           practices for storing 
          potatoes.
      <p> Temperature: Store potatoes at a temperature between 43–50°F (6–10°C)1. This range is slightly               warmer than a refrigerator 
          and 
          can be found in places like a root cellar, basement, or some garages.
          Darkness: Keep potatoes in the dark to prevent them from turning green and developing high                   solanine content, which can be      
          toxic.
          Humidity: A cool, humid environment is ideal. If you have an unheated basement, that’s a perfect             spot. An insulated garage or 
          shed might also work during the winter.
          Ventilation: Ensure that the storage area has good ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, which 
          can lead to rot.
          Container: Use breathable containers like burlap sacks, paper bags, or cardboard boxes to store              the potatoes. Avoid plastic 
          bags as they can trap moisture and cause decay.
          Separation: Do not store potatoes near onions, as the gases they emit can hasten spoilage.
          Inspection: Regularly check your potatoes for sprouts or signs of spoilage and remove any affected           ones to prevent the spread 
          to healthy tubers.</p>
